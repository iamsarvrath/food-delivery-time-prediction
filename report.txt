Food Delivery Time Prediction - Project Summary Report
------------------------------------------------------

This project focused on predicting food delivery time using machine learning by applying a full pipeline that included data cleaning, feature encoding, scaling, visualization, and model development. Key findings showed that features like distance and order cost significantly influenced delivery time, with strong correlations observed during exploratory analysis. Two models were built: a linear regression model to predict continuous delivery times, which demonstrated reasonable performance based on metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score; and a logistic regression model to classify whether a delivery would be delayed, which achieved good accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a strong ROC-AUC value. Insights from the analysis suggest that delays can be mitigated by optimizing delivery routes, planning better around peak traffic hours, and enhancing staff training. These recommendations aim to reduce delivery time variability and improve customer satisfaction through data-driven decision-making.
