Food Delivery Time Prediction - Project Summary Report
------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
-----------
This project aims to predict the food delivery time based on several input features such as:
- Distance between the restaurant and the customer
- Weather conditions
- Traffic levels
- Type of delivery vehicle
- Delivery person experience
- Order cost

The project involves both regression (predicting delivery time) and classification (predicting if the delivery is fast or delayed).

Dataset Overview:
------------------
The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features. The main target variable for regression is "Delivery_Time". 
For classification, a binary column "Delayed" was created based on whether the delivery time is above the median.

Data Preprocessing:
---------------------
- Missing values were handled using median imputation.
- Categorical variables were encoded using LabelEncoder.
- Numeric features were standardized using StandardScaler.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
---------------------------
- Correlation matrix was used to identify relationships between features.
- Boxplots were used to detect outliers.
- Traffic and distance were found to be strong predictors of delivery time.

Modeling:
---------
1. Linear Regression:
   - Used to predict actual delivery time.
   - Evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared metrics.

2. Logistic Regression:
   - Used to classify deliveries as "fast" or "delayed".
   - Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve.

Insights:
---------
- Delivery time increases significantly with poor traffic and weather conditions.
- High traffic periods can be targeted for better route optimization.
- Training delivery staff and matching agents based on proximity can improve efficiency.

Files Included:
---------------
- Food_Delivery_Time_Prediction.ipynb : The Jupyter Notebook with all the code and results.
- Food_Delivery_Time_Prediction.csv   : The dataset used.
- README.md                          : Overview of the project.
- This report                        : Summary of the entire assignment.

Conclusion:
------------
This project demonstrates how machine learning models can help optimize food delivery operations and enhance customer satisfaction by predicting delivery times more accurately.
