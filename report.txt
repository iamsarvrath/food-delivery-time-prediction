Food Delivery Time Prediction - Project Summary Report
------------------------------------------------------

This project aimed at forecasting food delivery time through the use of machine learning by implementing a complete pipeline involving data cleansing, feature 
encoding, scaling, visualization, and model building. Of paramount importance was finding that factors such as distance and order price had a huge impact on delivery
time, with high correlations being seen during exploratory analysis. Two models were constructed: a linear regression model to forecast continuous delivery times, 
which performed reasonably well on the basis of the performance measures such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score; and a logistic
regression model to predict whether a delivery would be delayed, which had good accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a high ROC-AUC value. The analysis presents
findings that delays can be avoided by streamlining delivery routes, planning in advance off-peak hours, and improving staff training. These suggestions are intended
to minimize delivery time variability and enhance customer satisfaction through evidence-based decision-making.
