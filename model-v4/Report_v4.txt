Report for Model-v4

Three primary phases were used to analyze and model the food delivery dataset: Data Preprocessing, CNN-based Neural Network Classification, and Model Validation.

1. Data Preprocessing:
   * All categorical features were label-encoded, and numerical features were normalized using MinMaxScaler.
   * Geographic distance was considered using the existing "Distance" column.
   * Time-based features such as `Order_Hour` and `Rush_Hour` were engineered.

2. CNN-Based Classification:
   * A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used on simulated 2D image data representing delivery routes.
   * Architecture:
     * Two Conv2D layers with ReLU activations followed by MaxPooling2D.
     * A Flatten layer feeding into a dense hidden layer and a softmax output layer.
   * Training was performed over 10 epochs with the following final validation metrics:
     * Accuracy: 53%
     * Precision: 51% (Class 0), 60% (Class 1)
     * Recall: 86% (Class 0), 21% (Class 1)
     * F1 Score: 64% (Class 0), 31% (Class 1)

3. Model Evaluation and Validation:
  * K-Fold Cross-Validation (k=5) produced the following fold accuracies:
     * Fold 1: 54.00%
     * Fold 2: 51.50%
     * Fold 3: 46.00%
     * Fold 4: 59.00%
     * Fold 5: 55.00%
     * Mean Accuracy: 49.77%
   * Logistic Regression (as a benchmark model) with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning achieved:
     * Best Parameters: C = 10
     * Best Score: 50.2%

## Conclusion:
While CNN demonstrated the capability to learn from spatial patterns, its performance on the simulated data was modest. Traditional logistic regression with tuned parameters offered comparable results. More sophisticated CNN designs or richer features might improve accuracy.

## Insights from Feature Engineering and Modeling
* Rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM) were engineered as a binary feature, showing correlation with delayed deliveries.
* Distance and tip amount showed some variability with delivery time but were not dominant predictors.
* CNN model performance indicates that spatial representation may help but requires further tuning and real image-based data.

## Actionable Insights
Based on the preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling phases, the following steps are recommended:
1. Collect real image-based route or traffic data to enhance CNN performance.
2. Enrich the dataset with weather and traffic severity scores if available.
3. Consider ensemble methods combining CNN outputs with traditional tabular models.
4. Use rush hour indicators to optimize delivery windows and reduce delays.
5. Evaluate additional models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) for potential accuracy improvements.

Final Summary:
The analysis of the food delivery dataset using a CNN-based approach revealed modest predictive performance, with a validation accuracy of 53% and F1 scores of 64% 
(Class 0) and 31% (Class 1). Benchmarking with logistic regression achieved a similar accuracy of 50.2%. Feature engineering highlighted rush hours as a relevant 
factor influencing delivery delays, while other features like distance and tips showed weaker predictive power. To improve model performance, integrating real-
world image or traffic data, exploring ensemble models, and testing algorithms like XGBoost are recommended. These enhancements can better capture delivery 
dynamics and optimize operational efficiency.
