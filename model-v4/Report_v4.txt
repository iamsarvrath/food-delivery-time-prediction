Food Delivery Time Prediction Report – Model-v4

Summary:
The CNN-based classification analysis revealed modest predictive capability for delivery time estimation, with the following key performance values:
- Validation Accuracy: 53%
- F1 Score: 64% (Class 0), 31% (Class 1)
- Precision: 51% (Class 0), 60% (Class 1)
- Recall: 86% (Class 0), 21% (Class 1)
- Strong Classifier Performance: None (no class exceeded 70% F1-score)

The strongest class-wise performance was for Class 0 (on-time deliveries), while Class 1 (late deliveries) suffered from lower recall and precision.
These results indicate the CNN model can detect spatial and temporal patterns to some extent but struggles with late delivery predictions. Model performance may 
improve with real image-based route data or ensemble methods combining CNN with traditional classifiers.
The analysis provides a baseline for future improvement rather than final deployment, signaling the need for deeper feature integration and model optimization.

Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
- Dataset Characteristics:
  - Categorical features were encoded using LabelEncoder.
  - Numerical features were scaled using MinMaxScaler.
  - Dataset included features such as Order Time, Distance, and Tip Amount.

- Engineered Features:
  - Order_Hour extracted from timestamp to capture temporal patterns.
  - Binary feature Rush_Hour created for 7–9 AM and 5–7 PM windows.
  - Delivery distance preserved as a key spatial metric.

2. CNN-Based Neural Network Classification:
- Model Architecture:
  - 2 Conv2D layers with ReLU activation + MaxPooling
  - Flatten layer → Dense hidden layer → Softmax output
  - Training over 10 epochs on synthetic 2D delivery route matrices

- Performance Metrics:
  - Accuracy: 53%
  - Precision:
    - Class 0 (on-time): 51%
    - Class 1 (late): 60%
  - Recall:
    - Class 0: 86%
    - Class 1: 21%
  - F1 Score:
    - Class 0: 64%
    - Class 1: 31%

3. Model Evaluation and Validation:
- K-Fold Cross-Validation (k=5):
  - Fold 1: 54.00%
  - Fold 2: 51.50%
  - Fold 3: 46.00%
  - Fold 4: 59.00%
  - Fold 5: 55.00%
  - Mean Accuracy: 49.77%

- Benchmark Model – Logistic Regression:
  - Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV
  - Best Parameters: C = 10
  - Best Score: 50.2%

Key Findings:

1. Strongest Predictive Patterns:
- CNN performed better on Class 0 (on-time deliveries) due to more consistent patterns in early delivery data.
- Class 1 predictions (late deliveries) had poor recall, suggesting underfitting or class imbalance.

2. Feature Insights:
- Rush hour showed consistent correlation with delayed deliveries.
- Geographic Distance influenced delivery time but lacked strong predictive power.
- Tip Amount had weak association with target classes.

3. Correlation Insights:
- Positive correlation: Rush_Hour and delivery delays
- Weak/no correlation: Tip_Amount, Order_Hour, and delay status

Actionable Recommendations:

1. Model Enhancements:
- Collect real route or traffic image data to feed CNNs with more realistic spatial patterns.
- Test ensemble strategies combining CNN outputs with logistic regression or tree-based models.
- Rebalance training data to improve minority class (late delivery) recall.

2. Feature Enrichment:
- Add weather data, traffic congestion levels, and live road events.
- Include restaurant workload and rider availability to reflect operational variables.

3. Operational Improvements:
- Use rush hour flags to adjust staffing and optimize order batching.
- Predict delivery bottlenecks early using probabilistic thresholds from CNN output.
- Create alert systems for high-risk delivery windows.

Final Summary:
The CNN-based classification model for delivery time prediction achieved a validation accuracy of 53%, with clear strength in identifying on-time deliveries (F1:
64%) but poor performance in late delivery detection (F1: 31%). Cross-validation showed modest performance stability, with mean accuracy at 49.77%. Logistic
regression performed similarly, achieving a best score of 50.2% with tuned parameters.

Feature engineering revealed Rush_Hour as a meaningful feature influencing delivery time, while other features showed limited predictive utility. To boost model 
performance, richer spatial and temporal data, integration of external traffic/weather information, and hybrid model designs (CNN + traditional ML) are \
recommended. These improvements will enhance the predictive power and enable better optimization of delivery operations.
