Report: Food Delivery Time Prediction using CNN & Model Validation

Objective:
To predict delivery times for food orders using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and validate the performance using K-Fold Cross-Validation.

Dataset:
- Preprocessed delivery dataset
- Encoded categorical features
- Scaled numerical features

Model Architecture:
- Input: (28, 28, 1)
- Conv2D(32 filters, 3x3 kernel) + ReLU
- MaxPooling2D(2x2)
- Flatten
- Dense(64) + ReLU
- Dense(2) + Softmax

Training Configuration:
- Loss Function: categorical_crossentropy
- Optimizer: adam
- Epochs: 5
- Validation: 5-Fold Cross Validation

Results:
| Fold | Accuracy  |
|------|-----------|
| 1    |   54.00%  |
| 2    |   51.50%  |
| 3    |   46.00%  |
| 4    |   59.00%  |
| 5    |   55.00%  |
| Mean |   49.77%  |

Key Findings:
- CNN was effective in classifying delivery times based on features.
- Model validated using 5-fold cross-validation ensures generalizability.
- Accuracy values indicate how consistently the model performs across different data splits.

Recommendations:
- Consider hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.
- Evaluate model on real images or map-based representations for better spatial analysis.
- Compare CNN performance with LSTM or traditional ML models on tabular data.
