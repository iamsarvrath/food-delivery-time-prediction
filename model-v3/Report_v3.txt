Model Comparison
----------------
Two approaches were used to analyze the food delivery dataset: Clustering (K-Means and Hierarchical) and a Neural Network classification model.

1. K-Means Clustering was used to group deliveries based on similar characteristics. Using the Elbow Method, optimal clusters were determined. 
   It showed that delayed deliveries tend to cluster in regions with poor traffic and adverse weather.

2. Hierarchical Clustering helped visualize feature groupings through a dendrogram. It highlighted how closely traffic and weather conditions relate to delivery delays.

3. A Neural Network was trained to predict whether a delivery would be 'Fast' or 'Delayed'. The model achieved the following metrics:
   - Accuracy: 97.5%
   - Precision: 95.45%
   - Recall: 100%
   - F1 Score: 97.67%

Conclusion: While clustering methods provide insight into patterns and customer segments, the neural network model is more effective for precise delivery time prediction.

Insights from K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering
--------------------------------------------------
- Traffic congestion and bad weather strongly correlate with delayed deliveries.
- Certain times of day, especially rush hours, form clusters of delayed orders.
- Orders with high priority or short distances typically appear in 'Fast' clusters.
- Hierarchical clustering shows strong linkage between traffic and weather influence.

Actionable Insights
-------------------
Based on both the clustering patterns and predictive power of the neural network, the following recommendations are made:

1. Optimize routes by avoiding high-traffic and weather-prone zones based on historical data clustering.
2. Introduce smart scheduling to shift non-urgent deliveries outside rush hours.
3. Allocate additional delivery resources during peak hours and in areas with adverse weather forecasts.
4. Integrate the neural network into live delivery systems to proactively alert customers and re-prioritize at-risk deliveries.
5. Use cluster analysis to dynamically adjust delivery charges or offer incentives for flexible delivery slots.
