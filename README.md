# Food Delivery Time Prediction

## Objective
Predict delivery times based on factors like distance, weather, traffic, etc., using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear Regression Model for predicting delivery time
- Logistic Regression Model for classifying fast vs. delayed deliveries
- Visualizations and performance metrics

## Results
- Linear Regression metrics: RÂ², MAE, MSE
- Logistic Regression metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
